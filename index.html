    <h1>We all need to be a fan of traveling!</h1>

<br>

<p>I love the idea of traveling and I am hoping to someday be able to travel to as many countries as possible. I think it is so important as humans to experience the world other humas live in.</p>

<strong>Here are a few reasons you should want to travel too:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>Travel Reduces stress</li>
    <li>Travel Lowers the Risk of Depression</li>
    <li>Travel Boosts Happiness and Satisfaction.</li>
</ul>

<p>My favourite quote about traveling the world says: </p>
<blockquote cite="https://theplanetd.com/the-ultimate-travel-quotes-as-chosen-by-you/">
    <p><em>“The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.” ~ Saint Augustine</em></p>
